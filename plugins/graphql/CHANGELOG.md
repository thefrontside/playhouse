### Minor Changes

- f99de6d: Replacing batch-loader with getEntitiesByRefs from Backtage Catalog Client

  Backstage Catalog REST API is now providing an endpoint for querying entities by refs.
  This was in introduced in https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/14354 and
  it's available via the [Catalog API Client getEntitiesByRefs method](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/catalog-client.catalogapi.getentitiesbyrefs).

  This changes makes our `@frontside/backstage-plugin-batch-loader` unnecessary. In this release, we're deprecating
  `@frontside/backstage-plugin-batch-loader` and replacing it with native loader.

  You'll need to change your graphql plugin to pass the catalog client to the GraphQL plugin router.
